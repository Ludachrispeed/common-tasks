A collection a Gulp tasks that I like to use in projects.

Assumes a directory structure like

    app/
    gulp/
      +- special-task.js
      +- common-tasks/    <-- git submodule here
        +- clean.js
        +- ... etc
    dist
      +- css/

Intended to be included in other projects as a git submodule.
